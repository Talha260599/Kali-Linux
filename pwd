pwd command:

Certainly! The `pwd` command stands for "print working directory." When run this command, it will display the current working directory (currently in) in the terminal.

If run the `pwd` command in terminal, it will output the full path of current directory. For example:

(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ pwd
/home/kali

In this example, the current working directory is "/home/kali". The output will show the absolute path to current location in the file system.
